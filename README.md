# Demographic-Data-Analyzer

This Python project analyzes demographic data from the 1994 U.S. Census database using **Pandas**. The dataset includes information such as age, education, work hours, income levels, and more.

The goal is to explore patterns in the data, such as how education affects income, what countries have the highest earnings, and which occupations are most lucrative in specific regions.
